## Key Takeaways:

### What is an application?

- An **application** is a computer program. It is a set of instructions that a computer runs to perform a specific task. A **computer program** is written as code in a programming language (Java, Python, and C++). Computer programs are generally called **software**. 
- Applications run on different types of devices and are accessed in different ways. Web apps are accessed through a web browser and runs on a web server or app server. Mobile apps run in and are accessed through a mobile device. Desktop apps run in and are accessed through a desktop computer. IoT apps runs in and are accessed through appliances or specialized devices that connect to the internet. 

### What is cloud computing?

- The on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. 
- Six benefits of cloud computing: 
    - Upfront expense associated with maintaining data centers is replaced with variable expenses where cost depends on the computing resources that were consumed. This ultimately saves on cost. 
    - Time and money spent on managing servers and infrastructures is on focused on applications and customer support. 
    - Eliminate predicting the capacity of an infrastructure by auto scaling in or out in response to demand. 
    - Massive economies of scale: the more services being used and aggregated on the cloud, the cheaper the services become for users.
    - Fast development and deployment of applications (flexiable and agile) Access to new resources within minutes versu setting up on-prem. 
    - Go global within minutes and with low latency. 

### Cloud Computing Models and Deployment Strategies:

#### Models:
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Provides highest level of flexiabilty and management over IT resources. The building components for cloudIT/architecture. Acess to networking featires, computers (vitural or hardware) and data storage.
- Platform as a Service (PaaS): Provider manages the hardward and operating systems where as the users focus on the deployment and management of applications. 
- Software as a Service (SaaS): completed software product thats fully managed and ran by the Provider. Examples: Zoom, Gmail DropBox, WhatsApp

#### Deployment: 
- Cloud: Migrate existing applications or design and build new application in Vitural Machines. 
- Hybrid: cloud-based resources are connectede to on-prem infrastructure. 
- On-premises or Private: deployed on-prem using virtualization and resources management tools.
