- A service that secures control to other AWS services by managing how reources are accessed and which actions can be performed.
- Consider *Who can access which AWS services?* and *What is the user or system allowed to do with the service?*.
- IAM reduces sharing passwords or access keys when granting access rights, also easily turning on and off a user's account.
